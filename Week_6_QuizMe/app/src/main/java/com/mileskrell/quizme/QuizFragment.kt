    There are a lot of fun things you could add to this app. Here are some ideas:

    - Turn this into a game. The goal would be for the user to answer as many problems correctly as possible in 60 seconds.
    - Maybe the app could keep track of both how many problems the user got correct, AND how many they got incorrect.
    - At the end of the game, the user could be sent to a new fragment that would tell them their score.
      - There could be a share button so people could tell their friends how they did (just like in
        the App Navigation lesson in the Developing Android Apps with Kotlin Udacity course).
      - There could also be a button that would let them play the game again.
